# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This folder contains OctoAcme's project management processes: concise guidance, templates, and checklists used across project initiation, planning, execution, release, and continuous improvement. Use this README to quickly find the process doc you need and to understand our core principles.

## Brief overview

- **Customer-first**: prioritize customer value and usability.
- **Iterative delivery**: deliver small, testable increments and validate with metrics.
- **Clear ownership**: each project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead.
- **Data-informed decisions**: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- **Continuous improvement**: run retrospectives and track action items.

**Lifecycle (high-level)**: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Close &amp; Retrospective
